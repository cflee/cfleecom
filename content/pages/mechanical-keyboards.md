Brief inventory and notes of my mechanical keyboard stash

## Boards

Daily drivers:

- Keyboardio Model 100, with Kailh Box Silent Linear
- Planck, with Gazzew Boba U4 (silent tactile)

Working but not used:

- Keyboardio Atreus, with Gateron browns (maybe box browns? barely tactile), the other linears are elsewhere

Not really working:

- Kbd67
- Let's Split Eh
- The first incarnation of the Planck
- Filco Minila Air

### Keyboardio Preonic

Backed the Kickstarter in August 2024, estimated delivery January 2025, still waiting for it to ship.

USB-C connector, Kaleidoscope firmware, hotswap

### Keyboardio Model 100

Backed the Kickstarter in July 2021, estimated delivery January 2022, shipped September 2022.

USB-C connector, RJ45 split connection, Kaleidoscope firmware, hotswap

This is a _really_ nice keyboard.
I got it in Walnut and it's amazing.

The thumb keys are great, the palm button is ingenious.

Daily driver.

I should get round to swapping the linears out for the silent tactiles.

### Keyboardio Atreus

Backed the Kickstarter in April 2020, estimated delivery August 2020, shipped September 2020.

USB-C connector, Kaleidoscope firmware, hotswap

These came with some switches but swapped out to the Gateron browns right now

I couldn't get used to the layout, especially the bottom row and the thumb keys, no matter how much I tweaked the layout.
I really want the sixth column on the outside and feel like there's just not enough keys when coming from the Planck (where I have a mere 6 extra keys).
The two extra keys that make this an Atreus44 instead of Atreus42 are difficult to reach.

### Kbd67 Lite ("KBD67mkii RGB-V2)

Pre-ordered in November 2020, shipped February 2021.

USB-C connector, Kbd firmware/VIA, hotswap

The PCB kept having repeated issues, it just won't resume or connect for a very long time, and then it would work for a while.
I tried reflashing with newer firmware from Kbdfans but no dice in the end.
It's a nice board at a great price but too bad it didn't keep working.

On the bright side I won some Gateron browns in a raffle.

### Let's Split Eh

This is basically the Planck (4x12) layout but split into two halves, and with an acrylic sandwich case.

Soldered, Gazzew Boba U4 62g

Pre-ordered group buy in May 2018, shipped July 2018.

I think I stopped using this because of switch chattering issues, and I got tired of desoldering and replacing them.
Probably not the board's fault, but who knows.

### Planck

Joined a Massdrop drop (group buy) in March 2017, shipped September 2017.
The Zealios 65g switches shipped later.

The board was faulty and I sent a warranty claim in February 2018, Massdrop sent a replacement kit (including plate and case).

I ordered the Rev 6.1 PCB in October 2020, shipped February 2021, and then rebuilt it with Gazzew Boba U4 switches.
This PCB finally has USB-C connector and Kailh hotswap sockets.
The rebuilt board (the third of its name) is still in use now.

### Filco Minila Air

I think that I was using this board in school so probably was before 2016?

I stopped using it in favour of the Planck because there were intermittent issues, there seemed to be an issue on the PCB where it would only work when flexed in a particular way.
