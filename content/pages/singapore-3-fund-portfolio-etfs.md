## Global Equity

This is a non-exhaustive list, only a few ETFs are highlighted.
All are Irish-domiciled UCITS funds.

### Developed Markets

For developed markets, large and mid cap, in accumulating form:

|  | [iShares Core MSCI World](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251882/ishares-msci-world-ucits-etf-acc-fund) | [SPDR MSCI World](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/msci-world-ucits-etf-sppw-gy) | [Vanguard FTSE Developed World](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9675/ftse-developed-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating) |

| Type | Developed markets, large and mid cap | Developed markets, large and mid cap | Developed markets, large and mid cap |
| Ticker on LSE in USD | IWDA | SWRD | VHVE |
| TER | 0.20% | 0.12% | 0.12% |
| Net AUM of Fund | USD ~~42.8bil~~ 56.2bil | USD ~~1.1bil~~ 2.8bil | USD ~~0.25bil~~ 1.1bil |
| Number of holdings | 1563 | 1543 | 2200 |
| IBKR Fractional Shares | No | Yes | Yes |

There are various distributing funds but they are not cheaper.
The iShares Core fund is the largest and most popular fund, the SPDR fund is the largest fund at 0.12% (also the other funds at that TER are distributing), and the Vanguard fund is the FTSE index fund.

### Emerging Markets

You can take the Developed Markets single funds above, and add some emerging markets exposure.
An MSCI World fund can be complemented by an MSCI Emerging Markets fund.
A FTSE Developed World fund can be complemented by a FTSE Emerging Markets fund.

|  | [iShares Core MSCI EM IMI](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/264659/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-imi-ucits-etf) | [Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9678/ftse-emerging-markets-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating) |
|---|---|---|
| Links | [justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BKM4GZ66) | [justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BK5BR733) |
| Type | Emerging markets, large mid and _small cap_ | Emerging markets, large and mid cap |
| Ticker on LSE in USD | EIMI | VFEA |
| TER | 0.18% | 0.22% |
| Net AUM of Fund | USD ~~18.5bil~~ 17.7bil | USD ~~0.14bil~~ 0.4bil |
| Number of holdings | 2994 | 1863 |
| IBKR Fractional Shares | Yes | Yes |

An MSCI EM IMI fund is used instead of an MSCI EM fund, as the TER is identical to the MSCI EM funds, so you might as well get a bit more coverage for the same price. (MSCI EM IMI includes emerging markets small cap, on top of MSCI EM.)

### Developed and Emerging Markets, single fund

For developed and emerging markets, large and mid cap, in accumulating form:

|  | [Vanguard FTSE All-World](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9679/ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating) | [iShares MSCI ACWI](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251850/ishares-msci-acwi-ucits-etf) |
|---|---|---|
| Links | [justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BK5BQT80) | [justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B6R52259) |
| Type | Developed and emerging markets, large and mid cap | Developed and emerging markets, large and mid cap |
| Ticker on LSE in USD | VWRA | ISAC |
| TER | 0.22% | 0.20% |
| Net AUM of Fund | USD ~~11bil~~ 7.6bil | USD ~~2.9bil~~ 8.3bil |
| Number of holdings | 3618 | 1607+ |
| IBKR Fractional Shares | Yes | Yes |

(This particular iShares MSCI ACWI fund holds bits of three other iShares funds, so the effective total number of holdings is likely a bit higher than stated here.)
