I've been maintaining a spreadsheet to compare the costs of buying certain ETFs (for global equity, Singapore equity, and Singapore fixed income) through various brokers and platforms.

The current version is the **[v2 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T0SnPLJxdzhi5kLIK2zxbWLGkX6ILfFLsIlhzG8o534/edit?usp=sharing)** on Google Sheets.

There are some assumptions that must be highlighted:

- It assumes you are looking to buy UCITS ETFs that are USD-denominated and listed on the LSE.
- It assumes you are a Singapore tax resident, and are investing from SGD cash in Singapore.
- It assumes you are making regular, i.e. monthly or less frequent, contributions of an regular-ish amount.

If any of these are not true, _the calculations or broker/platform selection may not apply_.

As always, do your own due diligence.
