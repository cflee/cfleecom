Hello! This is cflee's home on the internet.

Things posted on this website are my personal opinion, and do not represent those of my employer or anyone else.
I often only write posts when there's [something useful for search engines to index](https://xkcd.com/979/).

There's also some stuff on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cflee) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiangfong/) profiles.
