Hello! This is cflee's home on the internet.

I'm currently a software engineer at the Experimental Systems and Technology Laboratory.

Things posted on this website are my personal opinion, and generally do not represent those of my employer or anyone else. I usually post only when there's something useful for search engines to index.

You'll find more informative (but perhaps less useful) stuff on my GitHub or LinkedIn profiles.
