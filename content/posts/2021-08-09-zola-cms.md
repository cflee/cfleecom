title = "New CMS (III)"

Obligatory post to mark the switch to yet another static site generator, this time from Hugo to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

Zola is distributed as a single binary (Rust instead of Go, but as a user, who cares?), seems very focused and tightly scoped (perhaps to a fault, but we'll see...), uses the [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) template engine with Jinja2-style syntax (no more Go templates!!!), and [the docs](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) aren't too bad.

It's pretty nice that I got my Hugo site moved over without too much fuss, and even switched to and made some modifications to this theme, without having to read _all_ the docs.
And without having felt like I _needed_ to read all the docs.

I did get tripped up by having to do `get_sections()` on each of a section's array of subsection names, but really, things could be worse.

I also don't have tags (taxonomy) set up yet, so it's not 100% feature complete yet, but who needs that when people are only coming in to specific posts via search engines anyway? :)
Maybe I'll fix that next time, or more realistically, with the next CMS or static site generator.
