Obligatory post to mark when the switch to another static site generator was made, this time to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

It's distributed as a single binary (Rust instead of Go, but as a user, who cares?), seems very focused and tightly scoped (perhaps to a fault, but we'll see...), uses the [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) template engine with Jinja2-style syntax (no more Go templates!!!), and [the docs](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) aren't too bad.
