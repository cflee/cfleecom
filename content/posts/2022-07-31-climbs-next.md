## Gear

Apparently the EpicTV shop has good deals, it's just that the shipping from France breaks the deals on small orders.

Let's say for beginner shoes: as of writing, a pair of the La Sportiva Tarantula climbing shoes on EpicTV shop are going for EUR 70.99 (discounted 24% from EUR 93.50), which is a cool SGD 100.27, but shipping is EUR 19.90, which brings it back up to SGD 128.38.

At that point, if you can you might as well pick up those particular shoes at Kinetics Climbing (SGD 132.60 after 15% discount) or Campers' Corner (SGD 135), and be able to try a bunch of sizes on.
Between the two, Campers' Corner's shoe section is very spacious and you can take your time, but there's no wall with holds to test the shoes on, while Kinetics' shop is so tiny that you can't extend both arms and spin in a circle (maybe not even both elbows) but I think they let you step out to the wall and step on some holds.

I ended up getting my shoes at Campers' Corner.

The Spacerock chalk is really fine.

## Climbing gyms

### [Boulder Movement](https://www.boulderm.com/) (Rochor)

Third Boulder Movement gym visit!

Everyone tells me that this is the largest BM gym.
It does feel like it has a bit more than the Bugis location, at least as far as the actual bouldering walls go.
There's probably something for everyone.
There's a nice long stretch of slab wall right at the entrance, though it made me seriously consider whether too much of an slab angle is actually scarier.
Big overhangy cave that all the intermediate-and-up people flock to.
Quite a stretch of vertical-ish walls.
There was also some loft area that looks like it at least had an training wall of some kind that I didn't get round to checking out.

The position of kilter board feels a bit weird, right smack in the middle, I end up always having to carefully step around the passageway next to it if there's a group there instead of just one person climbing solo.

I guess these gyms with multiple locations have the same team of route setters moving around.
The grading around the levels that I'm climbing at seem to be fairly consistent across 3 sessions at 3 Boulder Movement locations, or at least I'm consistently being able to send problems graded 12 with some work and mostly really struggling with and not being able to complete most problems in the 13-15 range.

The capacity limit here is 50, and it was fully booked, it was fairly crowded but still felt bearable, this place having more open space compared to Bugis helps.
There's many benches around, and in one larger area what looks like a bunch of storage boxes double up as seating, so it feels relatively roomy and most people probably can find a spot if they want.
There is a bit of dead space at one corner, where there is a locked glass door/wall leading to the lift lobby outside, probably an artifact of the unit layout, but it also helps to open up the space a bit.

On the crash pads though -- it was a bit weird to see people flying off the wall while attempting a very dynamic move end up landing (with only a little rolling if at all) basically right up at edge of the crash pads.
I don't know what's standard for the pad width from the walls, but maybe I'm thinking of Boruda or Boulder+ or Lighthouse that all just have quite a lot of width, and other other places just do wall to wall because they're so close? 
The other factor might be that the benches mostly started out right on the edge of the pads, it'd definitely be a bit of an improvement to push them back from the pads, so probably do that when you're sitting down.

An interesting side-effect of either the distance to the low benches, or having the higher waist-height storage boxes set a little further back, is that there were some folks (in a group) who set up to video from the boxes instead... basically filming across an aisle and benches.
That was not great for them nor for the folks around who kept being told "(he/she) is videoing" because it's not obvious that standing around in the floor aisle behind benches outside the crash pads also involves looking behind you for camera angles!
I don't know why I'm bringing this up but it just stuck because they told me that and it just didn't register for quite a few moments what they were obliquely as king (I thought they were asking folks to move back to give more room on the crash pads).

Really nice playlist on during this visit.

### Origin Boulder (visit 2)

Back to where I had my first climb session!
This time during a weekday lunchtime and afternoon.

It was really nice and quiet, I think there were maybe 4-6 people there when we arrived, and maybe another 4 people showed up eventually.
(At the end of day, the booking system showed 10 off-peak climbers and 5 lunchtime climbers for the day.
So that means basically about a dozen other folks.)

They now have an iPad up on the back counter for folks to enqueue music.

I spent a bit of time studying the crash pad widths after the earlier observations from BM Rochor.
There are large sections here that are just basically wall-to-wall padded.
For the sections (Coffee Break, Tidal and the far corner of The Horizon) where the pads aren't that wide, it didn't seem to be an issue in practice?
They don't have the sort of benches that BM has, so that's part of it, but maybe the problems set in those areas just don't involve large dynamic sideways moves that can send people flying?
Now that I think about it, I don't think there were many problems of that style here. 
Or maybe the folks climbing today just weren't tackling problems with that approach.

Distribution of 54 problems across levels:

| Level | Count |
|:---|:---|
| OB1 | 2 |
| OB2 | 4 |
| OB3 | 6 |
| OB4 | 7 |
| OB5 | 8 |
| OB6 | 8 |
| OB7 | 8 |
| OB8 | 6 |
| OB9 | 2 |
| OB10 | 1 |
| ungraded | 2 (the "buddy route" pair of problems) |

(They maintain a full catalogue of their climbs on the KAYA app, that is what's on the wall-mounted iPad to see the grading and the videos, so at least I could make this list while sitting at home instead of having to go around making notes in the gym.)

It feels like the total number of problems is down a bit because one long stretch of wall was mostly taken up by the "buddy route" pair of problems, and there was a small section to the side of the arch that previously had around two problems that now has some kind of campus training setup instead.
Overall they don't seem to set too densely.

Before I sat down and started counting problems to make the table, I had thought that the higher end would be really sparse, but it seems that there's actually a decent number of OB7 and OB8.
I don't know what those levels translate to at other gyms yet, will have to ask the V4/V5-climbing folks whether they find the selection of problems at their level limited, but I guess that people climbing at any higher levels would probably be quite bored quick.

For this session, I was mostly expending energy on OB5 problems (but couldn't complete the one overhang OB5), OB4s were relatively straightforward, tried one or two OB6 problem and just mostly ran into a wall there.

With the benefit of hindsight and a tiny smidge more experience than the first session a mere 5 weeks ago, Origin seems a pretty good place for beginners to find their feet (even after a beer or two).
It isn't too intimidating like some of the other gyms can be with steeply overhang walls or training equipment all over the shop.
But all that probably hints at some questions about their ongoing sustainability especially against other gyms also targeting the same beginner-intermediate, CBD dweller (?) indoor climbing crowd.

We've seen the lunchtime promos that are probably moderately successful at best.
The ongoing "buddy route" schtick probably aligns well (in the photogenic... videogenic? sense) with what seems to be an ongoing push to feature climbers' videos on their Instagram stories, but it does take up a fair bit of space in an otherwise somewhat space-constrained gym.
I saw also on their IG that they tried an music-genre-themed-night on some Monday evening but I peeked at the booking stats and it didn't look great.
We can probably expect more attempts to drum up interest in the near future.

### BFF Climb (Bendemeer)

This is a really large gym in what's basically a few units and the "mall" atrium of CT Hub.
They have a section (in the units) that's lower 1-storey-tall walls, and then what's basically four tall and long walls (two islands) outside, as well as a rather large section of high walls with 24 autobelay lanes.
Two moon boards and an endurance wall and a hangboard area round it out.
I'd say that the total bouldering wall area is not quite as large as Boulder+ (The Chevrons) even after excluding the high wall / comp walls, though it should be larger than Boulder+ (Aperia), and certainly all the other places I've visited.

It was super crowded on a weekday evening.
There were probably more than 100 people around.
This location closes at 22:45, and people started streaming out around 22:00, but it was still super packed at around 22:15 when I left.
The counter staff are pretty fast at checking people in, since all the payment and slot booking needs to be done online, and all they need is your phone number or name to check in.
What I found pretty entertaining was that to pay for stuff like shoe rental or harness rental, they don't do it in their online booking system, they have a QR code that leads directly to a Stripe Checkout page...

The trade-off of maximising wall space is having less walking space, so you pretty much have to cut between people and the wall all the time when you're moving around.
It feels a bit more like Boulder Movement (Bugis) in that sense.

The crowd feels rather different, this was the largest concentration of NUS and SMU t-shirts that I've seen in a few years -- and a lot of folks look even younger than that.
The music might be following the crowd, lots of beats, quite a few tracks sounded like remixes.

I was looking at [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bffclimb/) afterwards and now I understand why there's a thriving multipass resale scene going on -- the multipasses bring the price down from $25 to $19, but they were also selling even larger multipasses during their pre-Bendemeer-opening sale that brought it down to $18/$17/$16, with the explicit provision that "you can share [the passes] with unlimited number of pax".

I wasn't trying very hard this session, 5 was easy but 6 was hard, and then I went off to try the high walls and endurance wall since they were less crowded.

### Fit Bloc (Kent Ridge)

I feel like I keep saying this or that gym is large or really large and that's not very quantifiable.
I'll add a section below where I try to roughly order them by my impressions of size.

This space is on the larger end, certainly smaller than BFF Climb (Bendemeer), but probably a little larger or on par with Boulder+ (Aperia).
That's just considering the main climbing space though, this location has a lot of other stuff, like a bunch of tables/chairs, a largish display for the "store", some exercise bicycles and treadmills, a room with weights and stuff (towel and non-climbing covered shoes required), a yoga studio that also holds the endurance wall (only liquid chalk allowed, no chalk bags)... the overall floor area is pretty large.

There's a high wall with six autobelay lanes, in the same side as the two-storey bouldering section, with the overhang stuff below and not-too-tall mostly vertical wall above.
Somehow the autobelays are really loud when someone is descending, I kept getting startled by the noise.
I didn't spot any loud branding on the devices, so I guess they are neither TruBlue nor Perfect Descent?
Some of them looked like they were a rope instead of a webbing band too.

There's a pretty large changing room with lockers (I dunno if these are functional), and it connects through to a bunch of shower cubicles and the usual toilet stuff.
This is an actual changing room with benches and stuff, not the changing cubicles that are typical.
I don't know what's going on but about half of the shower cubicles and toilet stuff was marked as under maintenance?
Is their lease running out or something?
It wasn't too dirty but the overall condition seemed a bit wonky, sensor taps that didn't work, toilet seat was slanted...

There's a four-lane 25m lap pool with lane markers downstairs, but I didn't go check it out since it was raining quite steadily.

On this Sunday, it was pretty busy around 11:00, though it thinned out especially closer to 13:00 as people headed out for lunch (lots of shoes and chalk buckets left around), and was quite quiet when I left just before 15:00.
People really need to not use bags to chope tables/chairs though, they were absolutely covered in bags and shoes everywhere so easily a third or half of all the bags around weren't in the shelves. 
Don't plan to use the "coworking space" on the weekend.

The problem setting here seems to be on the denser side, probably in the ballpark of Kinetics (just with taller walls).
There was a spot where I was staring at a yellow hold and trying to figure out which of the two adjacent identical-yellow problems it belonged to.
And elsewhere I was staring at a hold trying to decide whether it was bright lime green or dark lime green, thanks to some chalk on the hold.
The density is much more obvious in a photo, I took a snap to record one of the problems and in that probably 2m wide stretch there are 8 or 9 problems.
There was another section where there were a bunch of tiny starting handholds all on a volume and they basically just plonked a cluster of coloured discs below the volume to even be able to place all the L/R starting hand markers.

I was mostly cycling between the upstairs vertical section and the other slight-overhang section, depending on which section was less crowded, and ended up being able to send 2 bars more often than not, while being really stumped by a lot of 3 bar problems and only sending two.
There were some problems that I ended up getting to watch somebody else send (which isn't too often unless somebody is warming up, most folks seem to be climbing in the 5-6 bar range) and I was still quite mystified afterwards.

### Rough sizing of gyms

I'm trying to guesstimate the sizing from my impressions by considering the wall length of the "main" bouldering sections, excluding comp style walls, training stuff (moonboards, endurance walls), high walls with autobelay.
I'm excluding comp style walls in particular from this comparison because it makes the variance in problem density too high relative to the wall length.
I am very sure I will get some parts of the order wrong, sorry in advance!

Larger end:

1. Boulder+ (The Chevrons)
    - excluding comp wall and training area
1. BFF Climb (Bendemeer)
    - excluding high walls, two moonboards, endurance wall
1. Fit Bloc (Kent Ridge)
    - excluding high walls, moonboard, endurance wall, other spaces
1. Boulder+ (Aperia)
    - excluding upstairs endurance wall and training area
1. Boruda
    - excluding training area

Smaller end:

1. Boulder Movement (Rochor)
    - excluding training board
1. Fit Bloc (Depot Heights)
    - excluding training board
1. Boulder Movement (Bugis)
    - I am very split about this... do we count the comp wall or not? I am not sure if the rest of the regular walls exceeds Downtown or not
1. Boulder Movement (Downtown)
    - nothing to exclude
1. Lighthouse
    - excluding the training half
1. Origin
    - nothing to exclude
1. Kinetics
    - excluding the high wall
1. T-Hall
    - most of the space is for roped climbs, so it's mostly just one stretch of wall right by the entrance, excluding the endurance/training area behind

Fit Bloc (Kent Ridge) and Kinetics are the gyms that left an impression of especially dense problem setting.
